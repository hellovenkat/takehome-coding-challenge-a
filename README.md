# Take-Home Coding Challenge for Front End Developer

Thanks for taking the time to work on this take-home coding challenge.

## Timing

Please complete and submit your work within 3 days.

## Business Problem

A company is looking to achieve inorganic growth through acquisitions. They have asked us to develop an online tool to track and analyze potential target companies.

## Requirements:

Your finish product should be client ready.

You can be as creative as you want but at the bare minimum your prototype should allow the client to perform the following activities:

- View a list of targets
- Edit an exising target
- Create a new target
- Delete a target

## Assumptions

- Please use either Angular (Preferred) or React
- Feel free to use any CSS framework or 3rd party JS library to extend your app
- Focus on making the application configurable and add any charts/analytics you like
- Demonstrate use of web standards and best practices.
- Make the navbar responsive with at least one breakpoint (your choice as to how it looks on a smaller screen width).
- Data does not need to be persisted (please generate and use your own mock data)
- Examples of data to be captured:
  - Status (e.g. researching, pending approval, approved, declined)
  - Company Info
  - Key Contacts
  - Financial Performance

## Bonuses (only if you have time)

- Use SASS or LESS to pre-compile your CSS.
- Add a CSS animation with transitions.
- Add unit tests
- Using EY Color Palette:
  - #333333
  - #ffe600
  - #ffffff
  - #cccccc
  - #999999

## Documentation:

Please modify README.md to add:

1. instructions on how to build/run your application
2. link to the live site
3. A paragraph or two about what you are particularly proud of in your implementation, and why.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Fork this project on github. You will need to create an account if you don't already have one.
2. Complete the project as described below within your fork.
3. Push all of your changes to your fork on github and submit a pull request.
4. Publish your application to a live site.
5. You should email your recruiter to let them know you had submitted a solution. Make sure to include your github username in your email (so we can match applicants with pull requests).

Thank you and good luck!
